## 🧠 AI-Powered Notes App with Chatbot

A full-stack Notes Application powered by AI, built with the **MERN stack** — **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**. The app supports secure user authentication, full CRUD operations for notes, and automatic summarization using a local LLM via **Ollama** running the **Mistral model**. It also features a clean, responsive UI, a real-time chat interface, and robust RESTful API integration for seamless interaction.
